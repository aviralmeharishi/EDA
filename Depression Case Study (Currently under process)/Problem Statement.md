# 🚀 Problem Statement: "Exploratory Data Analysis for Unlocking Insights in Coding Challenges 🧩"
## 🌟 Overview:
- The repository focuses on analyzing data from coding challenges to uncover key patterns and insights 🕵️‍♂️, enabling better understanding of participant performance and challenge design.

## ❓ Problem:
- Coding challenge participants face varying levels of success 🎯 influenced by factors like problem complexity 🤔, time management ⏳, programming language choice 💻, and experience level 👩‍💻👨‍💻. However, the interaction between these factors is not well understood, leaving room for improvement in both participant strategies and challenge design.

## 🎯 Objective:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) 🛠️ to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies 🔍 in coding challenge data, leading to actionable insights for participants and platform developers.

## 📝 Key Goals:

### Understand Participant Behavior 🧑‍🤝‍🧑:
- Analyze demographic and participation data to highlight common traits of high performers 🌟.

### Assess Problem Characteristics 📊:
- Investigate problem difficulty levels, completion rates ✅, and solution times ⏲️ to uncover what makes challenges harder or easier.

### Identify Success Factors 🏆:
- Explore relationships between variables (e.g., programming language choice, time spent) and success rates 💡.

### Create Eye-Catching Visualizations 🎨:
- Use visual tools (e.g., heatmaps, scatter plots, bar charts 📈) to make findings accessible and engaging.

### Deliver Actionable Insights 💬:
- Provide data-driven tips and recommendations 💡 for participants to improve their strategies and for organizers to design better challenges.
