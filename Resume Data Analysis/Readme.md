# 🧠 Resume EDA & Scoring

This project explores and analyzes resume data to uncover insights and prepare the foundation for intelligent **resume scoring** and **job-fit matching**. Its a **Classic Natural Language Processing (NLP) Based Problem**.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset  
- Perform EDA to identify trends and patterns  
- Clean and preprocess text data from resumes  
- Visualize skill frequency, domain distribution, and applicant trends  
- Prepare for downstream ML tasks like job-role prediction or scoring

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data Manipulation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** – Visualization  
- **NLTK**, **re**, **scikit-learn** – Text Preprocessing & NLP  

---

## 📊 Key Highlights from EDA

- Extracted top skills and common job domains from free-text resume content  
- Cleaned missing and inconsistent values  
- Analyzed distributions of job categories, skillsets, and resume lengths  
- Applied NLP to tokenize and normalize resume text  

---

## 🔍 Sample Insights

- ✅ Most in-demand skills: `Python`, `SQL`, `Excel`, `Machine Learning`
- 🏆 Top job roles: `Data Science`, `HR`, `Web Development`
- 📉 Detected missing or poorly structured resumes for cleaning
- 🔠 Word frequency and domain-specific terms identified using NLP

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Feature engineering from resume content  
- Model training for resume ranking / classification  
- Web deployment using **Streamlit** or **Flask**
