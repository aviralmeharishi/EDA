## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> This dataset and project are created purely for **educational and learning purposes**. Please note the following:

1. **Synthetic Data**: All resumes, names, and job categories in this dataset are completely **fictional** and generated using the `Faker` library and other synthetic techniques.

2. **No Real Candidates**: The dataset does **not contain any personal or real-world applicant information**. Any resemblance to real individuals is purely coincidental.

3. **Learning Focused**: The primary goal of this dataset is to help learners practice **NLP, EDA, visualization**, and **machine learning workflows**.

4. **No Commercial Use**: This project is **not intended for any commercial, hiring, or HR use case**. It is strictly for non-commercial academic and practice scenarios.

5. **Safe for Public Sharing**: Since all data is fake, it is safe to upload and share publicly on platforms like GitHub or Kaggle.

6. **Resume Texts Are Randomized**: The resume texts have been generated to simulate various job domains, but they **do not represent actual professional resumes**.

7. **Skill Polishing Only**: The project aims to strengthen hands-on experience in **text preprocessing, classification, model building**, and **data storytelling** — not to evaluate real candidates.
