![Cereal Bowl Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Data%20Science-Cereal%20Analysis-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=python)

A data-driven deep dive into breakfast cereals, uncovering their nutritional value, sugar levels, and market positioning. This project explores patterns in popular cereals using **EDA, statistical summaries**, and **visualization techniques** to derive health-conscious and market-ready insights.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on cereal nutrition features like **calories**, **sugars**, **fiber**, **rating**, etc.
- 📊 Created meaningful **comparative visualizations** to assess healthy vs unhealthy cereals.
- 📌 Identified patterns such as correlation between sugar content and consumer ratings.
- 🔍 Grouped cereals by **manufacturers** and **types (hot/cold)** for targeted analysis.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- 🥄 **Higher sugar = lower rating**: A negative correlation exists between sugar content and cereal ratings.
- 💪 **High fiber cereals** tend to receive higher ratings, suggesting health-conscious consumers value fiber.
- 🏷️ **Manufacturer G** dominates the market with the most cereal entries.
- 🔥 **Hot cereals** generally have fewer entries and higher fiber, hinting at niche but health-driven market.
- ⚖️ Balanced cereals (moderate calories, low sugar, good fiber) score better in terms of consumer preference.
