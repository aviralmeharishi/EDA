# Customer Credit Data Analysis
## Project Overview
- This project aims to analyze factors influencing customer credibility using a dataset spanning April 2005 to September 2005. The dataset contains customer information and credit card payment details, including credit limits, repayment statuses, bill amounts, and payment history. By exploring demographic attributes like gender, education, marital status, and age alongside financial behaviors, the study seeks to differentiate between credible and non-credible customers. Insights derived from this analysis can inform financial institutions' risk assessment and decision-making processes when extending credit facilities.
